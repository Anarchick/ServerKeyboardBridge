**ServerKeyboardBridge** allow the server (Paper) to receive custom key press by the client. Without this mod, servers are not able to know which keyboard key is pressed.

Supported Minecraft version for client: **1.20.1**
Supported Minecraft version for server: **1.20+**

# Usage:
## client
When you connect to a compatible server, you can find a new button on the game pause menu. This button is for key bindings.
The server will receive the pressed key information and perform some logic in response (example: spawn your horse when you press H).
