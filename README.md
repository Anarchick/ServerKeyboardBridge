**ServerKeyboardBridge** allow the server ([Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper)) to receive custom key press by the client. Without this mod, servers are not able to know which keyboard key is pressed.

Supported Minecraft version for client: **1.20.1, 1.20.4, 1.21.1+**

Supported Minecraft version for server: **1.20+**

# Usage:
## client
When you connect to a compatible server, you can find a new button on the game pause menu. This button is for key bindings.
The server will receive the pressed key information and perform some logic in response (example: spawn your horse when you press H).
